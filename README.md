# Diabetic-retinopathy-using-ML-readme
Classification of DR(Diabetic retinopathy) using machine learning model.

👁️Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition or illness in human eyes beacuse of high blood sugar level. This lead to break the blood vessel in retina. There are **four garde** of DR:

## 1 Mild NPDR
## 2 Moderate NPDR
## 3 Serve NPDR
## 4 Proliferative DR

 ## **Tool used:** 🧰
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
  
This work used enhanced ResNet50 model with integration of  space-to-depth , Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks and multi-attention mechanism.
